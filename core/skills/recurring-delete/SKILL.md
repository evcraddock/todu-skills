# Delete Recurring Task

This skill deletes recurring task templates using `todu template delete`.

## When to Use

- User wants to permanently delete a recurring task
- User says "delete recurring task", "remove recurring task", etc.
- User wants to cancel a recurring task permanently (not just pause)

## What This Skill Does

1. **Identify Template**
   - Extract template ID from user's request
   - If not provided, list templates and ask which to delete

2. **Show Template Details**
   - Run `todu template show <id>` to get details
   - Display title, recurrence, project, and active status

3. **Warn if Active**
   - If template is active, warn user it will stop generating tasks

4. **Confirm Deletion**
   - Use AskUserQuestion to confirm
   - Show what will be deleted

5. **Delete Template**
   - Run `todu template delete <id> --force`
   - Display success message

## CLI Command

```bash
# Delete with confirmation prompt
todu template delete <id>

# Delete without confirmation (use --force since we confirm ourselves)
todu template delete <id> --force
```

## Example Interactions

4. User confirms
5. Runs `todu template delete 15 --force`
6. Shows: "Recurring task #15 'Daily standup' deleted successfully"

### Example 3: No ID provided

**User**: "Delete a recurring task"

**Skill**:

1. Runs `todu template list --type task` to show available
2. Asks: "Which recurring task do you want to delete?"
3. User provides ID or selects from list
4. Continues with confirmation flow

### Example 4: Template not found

**User**: "Delete recurring task #99999"

**Skill**:

1. Runs `todu template show 99999` → error
2. Shows: "Recurring task #99999 not found"

### Example 5: Cancel deletion

**User**: "Delete recurring task #14"

**Skill**:

1. Shows template details
2. Asks for confirmation
3. User selects: "Cancel"
4. Shows: "Deletion cancelled. No changes made."

## Natural Language Parsing

| User says                      | Parsed action            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| "delete recurring task 14"     | Delete template ID 14    |
| "remove recurring task #14"    | Delete template ID 14    |
| "cancel recurring task 14"     | Delete template ID 14    |
| "delete recurring task"        | List and ask which one   |
| "remove the weekly review"     | Search by name, confirm  |

**Note**: "cancel" in this context means permanent deletion, not deactivation.
If user wants to temporarily stop a recurring task, use recurring-update skill
to deactivate instead.

## Confirmation Flow

Always confirm before deletion using AskUserQuestion:

**Question**: "Delete recurring task '{title}'?"

**Options**:

- **Yes, delete permanently**: Remove this recurring task forever
- **Cancel**: Keep the recurring task

If template is active, include warning in the question:
"Delete recurring task '{title}'? (Currently active - will stop generating
tasks)"

## Error Handling

- **Template not found**: "Recurring task #X not found"
- **Invalid ID**: "Please provide a valid template ID"
- **No recurring tasks**: "No recurring tasks found"
- **CLI errors**: Parse and display error message

## Notes

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Use `--force` flag since we handle confirmation ourselves
- Warn user if template is active (will stop generating tasks)
- Consider suggesting deactivate instead if user might want to resume later
- Only deletes recurring task templates with `--type task`
- Does not delete any tasks already generated by the template
