# Project Register Skill Test

Test the project-register skill with these prompts:

## Test 1: Register a new project

```text
register project test-register-new
```

## Test 2: Register a project that already exists

```text
register project todu-tests
```

## Test 3: Register a project with a conflicting nickname

```text
register project test-register-skill
```

(This should trigger nickname conflict since "test-register-skill" already
exists)

## Test 4: Register another new project

```text
register project another-test-project
```
